# Face Recognition Project

Welcome to the **Face Recognition** project! This repository contains C and C++ implementations for facial recognition tasks. The main goal is to provide efficient algorithms and tools for detecting and recognizing faces from images or video streams.

## Features

- Face detection using classical algorithms.
- Face recognition and matching.
- Modular codebase—easy to extend.
- Written in C and C++ for performance.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- GCC or Clang compiler (for C/C++)
- CMake (optional, if CMakeLists.txt exists)
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) (recommended for image processing)
- Make (for build automation)
- Git

Install dependencies on Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential cmake libopencv-dev git
```

### Building the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/VEDANKAR/Facerecognisation.git
   cd Facerecognisation
   ```

2. **Build (using Make or CMake):**

   - If a `Makefile` is present:
     ```sh
     make
     ```

   - If using CMake:
     ```sh
     mkdir build
     cd build
     cmake ..
     make
     ```

### Usage

After building, run the executable as follows:

```sh
./facerecognisation [options]
```

Typical options:

- `--input <image_path>`: Path to the image file to process.
- `--video <video_path>`: Path to the video file for detection.
- `--help`: Show help message.

*(Note: The exact usage may depend on the implementation. Please refer to the code or add more details here if needed.)*
